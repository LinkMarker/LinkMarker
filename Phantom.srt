- MAN: Captain.
- Yes, sir?

3
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,418
Tell them we wish to board at once.

00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:08,213
- (MACHINERY BEEPING)
- With all due respect,

5
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:09,964
the ambassadors
for the Supreme Chancellor

6
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,466
wish to board immediately.

7
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:13,468
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

8
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:16,804
<i>As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal,</i>

9
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:21,017
<i>and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.</i>

10
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:46,125
I'm TC-14 at your service.

11
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,127
This way, please.

12
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:57,428
We are greatly honoured by your visit,
Ambassadors.

13
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:59,097
Make yourselves comfortable.

14
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,766
My master will be with you shortly.

15
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:08,064
I have a bad feeling about this.

16
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:11,109
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

17
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:15,238
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

18
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,490
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

19
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:20,994
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

20
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:23,871
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

21
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,873
But not at the expense of the moment.

22
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:29,043
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

23
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:31,087
Yes, Master.

24
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:34,924
How do you think this trade viceroy

25
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:36,843
will deal with
the chancellor's demands?

26
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:39,095
These Federation types are cowards.

27
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:42,140
The negotiations will be short.

28
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,560
What? What did you say?

29
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:48,479
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

30
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:50,481
I knew it.

31
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:52,942
They're here to force a settlement.

32
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:57,488
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

33
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:59,115
Are you brain-dead?

34
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,535
I'm not going in there with two Jedi.

35
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,121
Send a droid.

36
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,919
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

37
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:14,631
No. I sense an unusual amount of fear

38
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:16,257
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

39
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:29,729
DARTH SIDIOUS: <i>What is it?</i>

40
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:32,649
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

41
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:36,444
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

42
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:41,407
<i>Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slime
in my sight again.</i>

43
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:44,911
<i>This turn of events is unfortunate.</i>

44
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:49,499
<i>We must accelerate our plans.
Begin landing your troops.</i>

45
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:53,419
My lord, is that legal?

46
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:55,588
<i>I will make it legal.</i>

47
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,132
And the Jedi?

48
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:01,094
<i>The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.</i>

49
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:02,679
<i>Kill them immediately.</i>

50
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:07,016
Yes. Yes, my lord. As you wish.

51
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,603
Captain, look!

52
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:13,064
CAPTAIN: Shields up!

53
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,653
Sorry.

Dioxis.

55
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:29,580
<i>They must be dead by now.</i>

56
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:32,417
<i>Destroy what's left of them.</i>

57
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,927
Oh. Excuse me.

58
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,637
Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.

59
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:46,139
Roger, roger.

60
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:48,766
Uh-oh. Blast them.

61
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,982
What is going on down there?

62
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:58,025
We lost the transmission, sir.

63
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:05,783
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

64
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:08,870
Well, no, but I don't...
Seal off the bridge.

65
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,997
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

66
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,624
I want droidekas up here at once!

67
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,169
We will not survive this.

68
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:29,140
Close the blast doors!

69
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,940
That will hold them.

70
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:49,202
They are still coming through.

71
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,162
This is impossible!

72
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:58,628
Where are those droidekas?

73
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,839
Master! Destroyers!

74
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:09,806
They have shield generators!

75
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,517
It's a standoff. Let's go.

76
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:20,733
They're no match for droidekas.

77
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,196
Sir! They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

78
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:36,833
QUI-GON: Battle droids.
OBI-WAN: It's an invasion army.

79
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,920
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

80
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,298
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

81
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:45,800
Let's split up.

82
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:49,303
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

83
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:51,222
You were right about one thing, Master.

84
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,768
The negotiations were short.

85
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:59,605
Sir, a transmission from the planet.

86
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,816
RUNE: It's Queen Amidala herself.

87
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,194
At last we are getting results.

88
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:08,739
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

89

what I have to say, Viceroy.</i>

91
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:15,788
<i>Your trade boycott of our planet
has ended.</i>

92
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:18,124
I was not aware of such failure.

93
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:21,043
<i>I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now</i>

94
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:23,880
<i>and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.</i>

95
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:26,382
NUTE: I know nothing of any ambassadors.

96
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,801
You must be mistaken.

97
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,887
<i>Beware, Viceroy.</i>

98
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,723
<i>The Federation has gone
too far this time.</i>

99
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:37,894
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

100
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,771
You assume too much.

101
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,273
<i>We will see.</i>

102
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:47,862
- She's right. The senate will never...
- It's too late now.

103
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,698
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

104
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:56,203
But we must move quickly to
disrupt all communications down there.

105
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,085
PALPATINE: <i>Negotiations
haven't started because</i>

106
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:04,629
<i>the ambassadors aren't there?</i>

107
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,756
<i>How could that be true?</i>

108
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,760
<i>I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.</i>

<i>It must... Handiwork...</i>

<i>Negotiate... Ambassadors...</i>

111
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:18,142
<i>- Nobody would...</i>
- Senator Palpatine.

112
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,478
What's happening?

113
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,854
Check the transmission generator.

114
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:26,817
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing. Invasion.

115
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:29,320
The Federation would not
dare go that far.

116
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,864
The senate would
revoke their trade franchise,

117
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:33,449
and they'd be finished.

118
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:36,118
We must continue
to rely on negotiation.

119
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:39,747
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

120
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,041
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

121
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:45,920
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

122
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,089
Our security volunteers
will be no match

123
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,216
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

124
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:56,389
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

125
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:35,177
- Yes, Viceroy?
<i>- Captain, we've searched the ship,</i>

126
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:37,471
<i>and there is no trace of the Jedi.</i>

127
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,307
<i>They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.</i>

128
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:43,060
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

129
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:47,064

are not to be underestimated.</i>

I spake.

137
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:27,646
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

138
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,649
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

- A local.

145
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,716
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

More?

00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:59,136

Uh... On second thought, no.

The negotiations never took place.

It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

They've knocked out
all our communications.

In the main hangar. This way.

- QUI-GON: That won't be a problem.

Your Highness,
under the circumstances,

289
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,663
I suggest
you come to Coruscant with us.

00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:36,917
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,628
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

292
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:42,422
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

293
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:43,715
They can't afford to kill her.

294
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,717
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

295
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,803
There's no logic in
the Federation's move here.

296
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,888
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

297
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:52,641
Our only hope is
for the senate to side with us.

298
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,976
Senator Palpatine will need your help.

299
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:59,314
Either choice
presents great danger to us all.

300
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,024
We are brave, Your Highness.

301
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:04,611
If you are to leave, Your Highness,
it must be now.

302
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:07,072
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

303
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,908
Be careful, Governor.

304
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,087
We'll need to free those pilots.

305
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,256
I'll deal with that.

00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:30,379
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with,

480
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:32,256
not in the amount you're talking about.

481
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:35,176
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

482
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:36,719
I'll check back later.

about to be turned into orange goo.

He picked a fight with a Dug,

00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:57,049
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:06,934
Thanks, my young friend.

00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:48,976
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

514
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:52,188
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

515
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:55,191
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

516
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:57,276
You'll never reach the outskirts
in time.

517
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:01,405
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

Come on. I'll take you to my place.

He's a protocol droid to help Mom.

- He's perfect.
- Perfect.

I'll show you my racer.

<i>You must contact me.</i>

It's a trick. Send no reply.

Send no transmissions of any kind.

553
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,487
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

554
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:09,575
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

555
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:12,828
Either way, we're running out of time.

DARTH MAUL:
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

557
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:30,721
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

558

Move against the Jedi first.

559
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:36,018
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo

560
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,519
to sign the treaty.

561

At last we will
reveal ourselves to the Jedi.

At last we will have revenge.

All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

The Republic's antislavery laws...

571
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:14,098
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

572
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:16,267
We must survive on our own.

They have Podracing on Malastare.
Very fast, very dangerous.

I'm the only human who can do it.

577
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:34,368
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

578

Don't do that again.

You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:49,174
What makes you think that?

583
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:53,345
I saw your laser sword.
Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.

584
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:57,099
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

585
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:58,517
I don't think so.

586
00:41:58,726 --> 00:42:00,894
No one can kill a Jedi.

587
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:03,731
I wish that were so.

588
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:05,733
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

589
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:08,986
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

590
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,614
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

591
00:42:12,823 --> 00:42:16,952
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

592
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:24,626
I can see
there's no fooling you, Anakin.

593
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:27,796
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic,

594
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,840
on a very important mission.

595
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:33,260
How did you end up out here
in the Outer Rim?

596
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:36,930
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

597
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:38,974
I can help.

598
00:42:39,183 --> 00:42:43,020
- I can fix anything.
- QUI-GON: I believe you can.

599
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:45,773
But first we must
acquire the parts we need.

600
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:48,859
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

601
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:52,279
These junk dealers must have
a weakness of some kind.

602
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:56,950
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

603
00:42:57,034 --> 00:43:01,163
Podracing.
Greed can be a powerful ally.

604
00:43:01,455 --> 00:43:04,375
I built a racer. It's the fastest ever.

605
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,752
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

- Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

608
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,802
You could make him think it was yours

609
00:43:14,885 --> 00:43:16,970
and get him to let me pilot it for you.

610
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:21,392
I don't want you to race. It's awful.
I die every time Watto makes you do it.

611
00:43:21,475 --> 00:43:23,727
ANAKIN: But, Mom, I love it.

612
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:27,231
The prize money would more
than pay for the parts they need.

613
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:29,775
Anakin.

614
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:32,694
Your mother's right.

615
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:35,906
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

616
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,951
No.

617
00:43:43,956 --> 00:43:46,708
Mom, you say the biggest problem
in this universe

618
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:48,710
is nobody helps each other.

619
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:56,593
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

620
00:43:56,677 --> 00:43:58,387
We'll find some other way.

621
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,889
No.

622
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:03,559
There is no other way.

623
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:07,896
I may not like it, but he can help you.

624
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:11,024
He was meant to help you.

625
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,956
Are you sure about this?

626
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:28,834
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

The queen will not approve.

628
00:44:31,044 --> 00:44:33,797
The queen doesn't need to know.

629
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:36,758
- Well, I don't approve.

The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

631
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,224
How can you do this? Not on the
Republic credits, I think, huh?

632
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:47,060
My ship will be the entry fee.

Not bad, huh? A Nubian, huh?

We haven't much time.

954
01:13:02,212 --> 01:13:03,297
ANAKIN: Yipee.

955
01:13:09,845 --> 01:13:11,221
What about Mom?

956
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,226
Is she free too?

957
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:19,771
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

958
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:23,817
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

959
01:13:30,866 --> 01:13:34,077
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

960
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:37,622
It is time for you to let go.

961
01:13:37,956 --> 01:13:39,916
I don't want things to change.

962
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,669
But you can't stop the change

963
01:13:42,753 --> 01:13:46,548
any more than you can stop the suns
from setting.

964
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:48,842
I love you.

965
01:13:54,473 --> 01:13:56,433
Now hurry.

966
01:14:01,813 --> 01:14:03,357
Thank you.

967
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,360
I'll watch after him. You have my word.

968
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,781
Will you be all right?

969
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:12,783
Yeah.

970
01:14:16,328 --> 01:14:17,704
Oh, my.

971
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,414
Hello, Master Anakin.

972
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:21,583
Well, 3PO, I've been freed

973
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,378
and I'm going away in a starship.

974
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:27,214
Master Anakin,
you are my maker and I wish you well.

975
01:14:27,506 --> 01:14:31,635
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

976
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:36,973
I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you,
3PO, give you coverings and all.

977
01:14:37,057 --> 01:14:41,395
I'm gonna miss working on you.
You've been a great pal.

978
01:14:41,478 --> 01:14:44,022
I'll make sure
Mom doesn't sell you or anything.

979
01:14:44,731 --> 01:14:45,857
Sell me?

980
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:47,818
Bye.

981
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:50,070
Oh, my.

982
01:15:13,802 --> 01:15:16,012
I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.

983
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:18,098
Ani.

984
01:15:20,392 --> 01:15:22,269
Will I ever see you again?

985
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:26,606
What does your heart tell you?

986
01:15:27,941 --> 01:15:30,444
I hope so.

987
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:32,446
Yes.

988
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:34,156
I guess.

989
01:15:34,906 --> 01:15:38,076
Then we will see each other again.

990
01:15:40,454 --> 01:15:43,373
I will come back and free you, Mom.

991
01:15:43,457 --> 01:15:45,167
I promise.

992
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:56,428
Now, be brave,

993
01:15:57,095 --> 01:15:59,181
and don't look back.

994
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:02,058
Don't look back.

995
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:26,291
(WHIRRING, BEEPING)

996
01:16:46,478 --> 01:16:49,314
- Qui-Gon, sir, wait! I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

997
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:54,653
Go! Tell them to take off!

998
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:10,335
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

999
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:12,587
Take off.

1000
01:17:13,171 --> 01:17:14,965
Over there. Fly low.

1001
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:38,280
Are you all right?

1002
01:17:38,363 --> 01:17:39,781
I think so.

1003
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:41,408
What was it?

1004
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:45,912
I'm not sure, but it was well-trained
in the Jedi arts.

1005
01:17:45,996 --> 01:17:48,498
My guess is it was after the queen.

1006
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:50,917
What are we gonna do about it?

1007
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:53,128
(EXHALES)

1008
01:17:53,211 --> 01:17:55,130
We shall be patient.

1009
01:17:55,213 --> 01:17:58,300
Anakin Skywalker,
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1010
01:17:58,383 --> 01:18:00,093
Hi.

1011
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:03,930
You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.

1012
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:14,482
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving,

1013
01:18:14,566 --> 01:18:16,526
and you, Governor, are going to die

1014
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:19,029
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.

1015
01:18:19,112 --> 01:18:21,531
This invasion will gain you nothing.

1016
01:18:21,615 --> 01:18:24,659
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

1017
01:18:24,743 --> 01:18:26,703
Take him away.

1018
01:18:30,081 --> 01:18:32,626
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps

1019
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:34,961
for these rumoured underwater villages.

1020
01:18:35,045 --> 01:18:37,756
They will not stay hidden for long.

1021
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,603
<i>The death toll is catastrophic.</i>

1022
01:18:51,895 --> 01:18:54,272
<i>We must bow to their wishes.</i>

1023
01:18:54,356 --> 01:18:56,900
<i>You must contact me.</i>

1024
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:12,707
You all right?

1025
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:15,877
It's very cold.

1026
01:19:23,677 --> 01:19:26,596
You come from a warm planet, Ani.

1027
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,973
A little too warm for my taste.

1028
01:19:29,057 --> 01:19:31,226
Space is cold.

1029
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:33,395
You seem sad.

1030
01:19:34,854 --> 01:19:37,190
The queen is worried.

1031
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:39,359
Her people are suffering, dying.

1032
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:43,113
She must convince
the senate to intervene, or...

1033
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:46,825
I'm not sure what'll happen.

1034
01:19:48,243 --> 01:19:50,370
I made this for you...

1035
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:53,707
So you'd remember me.

1036
01:19:54,374 --> 01:19:57,127
I carved it out of a japor snippet.

1037
01:19:57,544 --> 01:20:00,046
It'll bring you good fortune.

1038
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,048
It's beautiful.

1039
01:20:02,132 --> 01:20:04,592
But I don't need this
to remember you by.

1040
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:11,850
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani,

1041
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:14,269
but my caring for you will remain.

1042
01:20:17,188 --> 01:20:20,275
I care for you, too, only I...

1043
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:22,277
Miss your mother.

1044
01:20:41,171 --> 01:20:45,049
PILOT: Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

1045
01:20:45,258 --> 01:20:47,051
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

1046
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:50,430
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

1047
01:21:19,834 --> 01:21:22,879
It is a great gift to see you alive,
Your Majesty.

1048
01:21:23,171 --> 01:21:26,007
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

1049
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:28,635
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.

1050
01:21:28,885 --> 01:21:31,262
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

1051
01:21:31,346 --> 01:21:35,517
Welcome, Your Highness. It's an honour
to finally meet you in person.

1052
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:37,185
QUEEN AMIDALA:
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

1053
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:41,147
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

1054
01:21:41,231 --> 01:21:44,317
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

1055
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:48,738
I'm grateful for your concern,
Chancellor.

1056
01:21:48,822 --> 01:21:53,201
There is a question of procedure,
but I'm confident we can overcome it.

1057
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,162
I must speak
with the Jedi Council immediately.

1058
01:21:56,246 --> 01:21:59,123
The situation has become
much more complicated.

1059
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:06,756
Ani, come on.

1060
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:22,188
The queen's a bein'
grossly nice, mesa tinks.

1061
01:22:22,272 --> 01:22:23,898
Pitty hot.

1062
01:22:52,093 --> 01:22:56,431
PALPATINE: There is no civility,
only politics.

1063
01:22:56,514 --> 01:23:00,435
The Republic is not what it once was.

1064
01:23:00,518 --> 01:23:05,565
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

1065
01:23:06,274 --> 01:23:09,861
There is no interest
in the common good.

1066
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:12,363
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

1067
01:23:12,447 --> 01:23:15,366
There is little chance
the senate will act on the invasion.

1068
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:18,369
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

1069
01:23:18,453 --> 01:23:22,332
If I may say so, Your Majesty,
the chancellor has little real power.

1070
01:23:22,415 --> 01:23:26,336
He is mired by
baseless accusations of corruption.

1071
01:23:26,419 --> 01:23:30,214
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

1072
01:23:31,174 --> 01:23:34,093
Our best choice would be
to push for the election

1073
01:23:34,177 --> 01:23:36,095
of a stronger Supreme Chancellor,

1074
01:23:36,179 --> 01:23:38,431
one who could control the bureaucrats

1075
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:40,433
and give us justice.

1076
01:23:41,392 --> 01:23:45,355
You could call for
a vote of no confidence

1077
01:23:45,438 --> 01:23:46,731
in Chancellor Valorum.

1078
01:23:47,106 --> 01:23:49,400
He has been our strongest supporter.

1079
01:23:49,484 --> 01:23:54,697
Our only other choice
would be to submit a plea to the courts.

1080
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:58,242
The courts take even longer to
decide things than the senate.

1081
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:01,245
Our people are dying, Senator.

1082
01:24:01,913 --> 01:24:05,083
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

1083
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:08,002
To be realistic, Your Majesty,

1084
01:24:08,086 --> 01:24:12,966
I think we're going to have to accept
Federation control for the time being.

1085
01:24:15,176 --> 01:24:17,512
That is something I cannot do.

1086
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:26,646
QUI-GON: He was trained
in the Jedi arts.

1087
01:24:26,813 --> 01:24:30,692
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

1088
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:34,988
Impossible. The Sith have been
extinct for a millennium.

1089
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:39,450
I do not believe the Sith could have
returned without us knowing.

1090
01:24:39,534 --> 01:24:42,495
Ah. Hard to see, the dark side is.

1091
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:45,498
MACE: We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

1092
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:49,377
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

1093
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:50,670
May the Force be with you.

1094
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:56,300
Master Qui-Gon.

1095
01:24:57,010 --> 01:24:59,637
More to say have you?

1096
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:03,266
With your permission, my master,

1097
01:25:04,559 --> 01:25:07,395
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

1098
01:25:08,438 --> 01:25:10,481
A vergence, you say?

1099
01:25:10,565 --> 01:25:12,734
Located around a person?

1100
01:25:13,067 --> 01:25:14,444
A boy.

1101
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:16,446
His cells have the highest concentration

1102
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:18,656
of midi-chlorians
I have seen in a life-form.

1103
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:21,701
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

1104
01:25:23,578 --> 01:25:24,662
MACE: You refer to the prophecy

1105
01:25:24,746 --> 01:25:27,290
of the one who
will bring balance to the Force.

1106
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:30,209
You believe it's this boy?

1107
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,920
- I don't presume to...
- YODA: But you do.

1108
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:35,631
Revealed your opinion is.

1109
01:25:35,715 --> 01:25:37,759
I request the boy be tested, Master.

1110
01:25:37,842 --> 01:25:39,177
YODA: Oh.

1111
01:25:39,927 --> 01:25:43,139
Trained as a Jedi you request for him?

1112
01:25:43,598 --> 01:25:45,933
Finding him was the will of the Force.

1113
01:25:46,017 --> 01:25:47,977
I have no doubt of that.

1114
01:25:52,273 --> 01:25:53,274
(SIGHS)

1115
01:25:54,859 --> 01:25:56,736
Bring him before us, then.

1116
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:09,665
The boy's here to see Padmé.

1117
01:26:09,749 --> 01:26:11,292
<i>Let him in.</i>

1118
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:18,508
I'm sorry, Ani,
but Padmé's not here right now.

1119
01:26:18,591 --> 01:26:20,468
Who is it?

1120
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:24,305
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.

1121
01:26:24,388 --> 01:26:26,307
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

1122
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:31,312
I'm on my way to the Jedi temple
to start my training, I hope.

1123
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:35,066
I may never see her again,
so I came to say good-bye.

1124
01:26:36,192 --> 01:26:37,568
We will tell her for you.

1125
01:26:37,652 --> 01:26:39,737
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1126
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:41,864
Thank you, Your Highness.

1127

The chair recognises the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1128

PALPATINE: Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate,

1129
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:13,688
a tragedy has occurred

1130
01:27:13,771 --> 01:27:17,400
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes

1131
01:27:17,942 --> 01:27:20,695
and has now engulfed our entire planet

1132
01:27:20,778 --> 01:27:22,572
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

1133
01:27:23,573 --> 01:27:25,158
This is outrageous!

1134
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:27,577
I object to the senator's statements.

1135
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:29,620
The chair does not
recognise the senator

1136
01:27:29,704 --> 01:27:31,747
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1137
01:27:31,831 --> 01:27:35,751
PALPATINE: To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala,

1138
01:27:35,835 --> 01:27:37,837
recently elected ruler of the Naboo,

1139
01:27:38,171 --> 01:27:40,089
who speaks on our behalf.

(SCATTERED MURMURS)

1141
01:27:46,137 --> 01:27:48,598
Honourable
representatives of the Republic,

1142
01:27:49,265 --> 01:27:52,059
I come to you
under the gravest of circumstances.

1143
01:27:52,143 --> 01:27:55,354
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade...

1144
01:27:55,438 --> 01:27:58,482
LOTT DOD: I object! There is no proof!

1145
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:00,735
This is incredible.

1146
01:28:00,818 --> 01:28:04,655
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1147
01:28:04,739 --> 01:28:06,657
The Congress of Malastare concurs

1148
01:28:06,741 --> 01:28:09,535
with the honourable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1149
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:12,663
- A commission must be appointed.
- VALORUM: The point...

1150
01:28:12,747 --> 01:28:15,666
- Excuse me, Chancellor.
- PALPATINE: Enter the bureaucrat.

1151
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:18,711
The true rulers of the Republic.

1152
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:22,632
And on the payroll of the
Trade Federation, I might add.

1153
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:27,303
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1154
01:28:28,846 --> 01:28:30,973
VALORUM: The point is conceded.

1155
01:28:31,557 --> 01:28:33,851
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission

1156
01:28:33,935 --> 01:28:36,687
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

1157
01:28:37,188 --> 01:28:38,606
I will not defer.

1158
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:42,318
I've come before you to resolve this
attack on our sovereignty now.

1159
01:28:42,652 --> 01:28:45,821
I was not elected
to watch my people suffer and die

1160
01:28:45,905 --> 01:28:48,199
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1161
01:28:51,327 --> 01:28:53,746
If this body is not capable of action,

1162
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:56,624
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1163
01:28:58,876 --> 01:29:01,504
I move for a vote of no confidence

1164
01:29:01,587 --> 01:29:03,965
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1165

Now they will elect a new chancellor,

1170
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:23,609
a strong chancellor,

1171
01:29:23,693 --> 01:29:27,405
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.

1172
01:29:28,281 --> 01:29:32,618
The boy will not pass the
council's test, Master. He's too old.

1173
01:29:32,702 --> 01:29:35,663
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

1174
01:29:35,746 --> 01:29:38,457
Do not defy the council, Master,
not again.

1175
01:29:38,833 --> 01:29:41,210
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1176
01:29:43,296 --> 01:29:46,841
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1177
01:29:46,924 --> 01:29:50,344
They will not
go along with you this time.

1178
01:29:50,428 --> 01:29:53,347
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1179
01:29:56,642 --> 01:29:57,768
ANAKIN: A ship.

1180
01:29:59,645 --> 01:30:01,605
A cup.

1181
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:03,232
A ship.

1182
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:05,776
A speeder.

1183
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:10,781
YODA: Hmm.

1184
01:30:13,826 --> 01:30:15,411
How feel you?

1185
01:30:16,203 --> 01:30:17,705
Cold, sir.

1186
01:30:19,165 --> 01:30:20,708
Afraid are you?

1187
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:22,710
No, sir.

1188
01:30:22,793 --> 01:30:25,296
See through you we can.

1189
01:30:25,546 --> 01:30:27,465
MACE: Be mindful of your feelings.

1190
01:30:27,548 --> 01:30:30,176
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1191
01:30:31,761 --> 01:30:34,096
I miss her.

1192
01:30:34,472 --> 01:30:36,724
Afraid to lose her, I think, hmm?

1193
01:30:36,974 --> 01:30:39,310
What has that got to do with anything?

1194
01:30:39,518 --> 01:30:41,604
Everything.

1195
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:44,774
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1196
01:30:44,857 --> 01:30:47,693
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

1197
01:30:47,777 --> 01:30:51,364
Hate leads to suffering.

1198
01:30:57,787 --> 01:31:00,706
I sense much fear in you.

1199
01:31:14,261 --> 01:31:17,264
Yousa tinking yousa people ganna die?

1200
01:31:17,348 --> 01:31:19,058
I don't know.

01:31:19,892 --> 01:31:22,228
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1202
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,315
I hope not.

1203
01:31:26,732 --> 01:31:29,527
Gungans no dyin' without a fight.

Wesa warriors.

1205
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:34,698
Wesa got a grand army.

PANAKA: Your Highness?

1208
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:44,417
Your Highness.

1209
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:47,545
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum

1210
01:31:47,753 --> 01:31:48,921
as Supreme Chancellor.

1211
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:53,008
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

1212
01:31:53,092 --> 01:31:57,638
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1213
01:31:57,721 --> 01:31:59,223
Who else has been nominated?

1214
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:03,853
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1215
01:32:03,936 --> 01:32:08,899
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1216
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:12,445
I will be chancellor.

1217
01:32:12,695 --> 01:32:15,114
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator,

1218
01:32:15,448 --> 01:32:18,701
there'll be nothing left of our people,
our way of life.

1219
01:32:18,784 --> 01:32:20,703
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1220
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:24,081
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1221
01:32:25,833 --> 01:32:30,212
Senator, this is your arena.

1222
01:32:30,296 --> 01:32:31,964
I feel I must return to mine.

1223
01:32:35,551 --> 01:32:37,636
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1224
01:32:37,845 --> 01:32:40,181
Go back?
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.

1225
01:32:40,264 --> 01:32:41,724
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1226
01:32:42,183 --> 01:32:44,351
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1227
01:32:44,435 --> 01:32:47,396
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1228
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:48,731
- Captain.
- PANAKA: Your Highness.

1229
01:32:48,814 --> 01:32:50,107
Ready my ship.

1230
01:32:50,191 --> 01:32:54,778
Please, Your Majesty,
stay here where it's safe.

1231
01:32:54,862 --> 01:32:57,990
It is clear to me now
that the Republic no longer functions.

1232
01:32:58,782 --> 01:33:03,120
I pray you will bring sanity and
compassion back to the senate.

1233
01:33:12,922 --> 01:33:15,341
The Force is strong with him.

1234
01:33:15,424 --> 01:33:17,384
He is to be trained, then?

1235
01:33:19,053 --> 01:33:21,639
No, he will not be trained.

1236
01:33:21,889 --> 01:33:23,390
No?

1237
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:27,520
He is too old.

1238
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:31,065
He is the chosen one. You must see it.

1239
01:33:31,148 --> 01:33:32,441
Hmm.

1240
01:33:32,608 --> 01:33:36,111
Clouded this boy's future is.

1241
01:33:39,031 --> 01:33:40,115
I will train him, then.

1242
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:47,331
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

1243
01:33:48,082 --> 01:33:50,626
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1244
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:52,836
Impossible to take on a second.

1245
01:33:53,003 --> 01:33:54,797
The code forbids it.

1246
01:33:55,172 --> 01:33:58,133
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1247
01:33:58,592 --> 01:34:01,887
Our own counsel
we will keep on who is ready.

1248
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:04,265
He is headstrong,

1249
01:34:04,348 --> 01:34:07,309
and he has much to learn of the
living Force, but he is capable.

1250
01:34:07,685 --> 01:34:09,520
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1251
01:34:12,022 --> 01:34:15,901
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

1252
01:34:16,068 --> 01:34:18,696
Now is not the time for this.

1253
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,824
The senate is voting
for a new Supreme Chancellor,

1254
01:34:21,907 --> 01:34:23,951
and Queen Amidala is returning home,

1255
01:34:24,034 --> 01:34:25,953
which will put pressure
on the Federation

1256
01:34:26,036 --> 01:34:27,705
and could widen the confrontation.

1257
01:34:27,788 --> 01:34:29,999
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1258
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:35,588
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1259
01:34:35,879 --> 01:34:39,925
This is the clue we need
to unravel the mystery of the Sith.

1260
01:34:40,593 --> 01:34:42,970
May the Force be with you.

1261
01:34:56,525 --> 01:34:58,944
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1262
01:34:59,028 --> 01:35:00,654
From your point of view.

1263
01:35:00,738 --> 01:35:04,700
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1264
01:35:04,783 --> 01:35:07,703
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1265
01:35:07,786 --> 01:35:09,955
The council will decide Anakin's future.

1266
01:35:10,039 --> 01:35:13,792
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1267
01:35:18,797 --> 01:35:22,635
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1268
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:24,970
You won't be, Ani.

1269
01:35:25,054 --> 01:35:26,805
I'm not allowed to train you,

1270
01:35:26,889 --> 01:35:29,099
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.

1271
01:35:29,558 --> 01:35:31,935
Always remember.

1272
01:35:32,019 --> 01:35:34,813
Your focus determines your reality.

1273
01:35:35,147 --> 01:35:38,442
Stay close to me and you'll be safe.

1274
01:35:38,776 --> 01:35:40,069
Master, sir,

1275
01:35:40,361 --> 01:35:43,739
I heard Yoda
talking about midi-chlorians.

1276
01:35:43,822 --> 01:35:47,284
I've been wondering.
What are midi-chlorians?

1277
01:35:48,744 --> 01:35:50,913
Midi-chlorians
are a microscopic life-form

1278
01:35:50,996 --> 01:35:53,290
that resides within all living cells.

1279
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:57,711
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1280
01:35:58,212 --> 01:36:01,507
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1281
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:05,219
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1282
01:36:05,302 --> 01:36:08,222
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist

1283
01:36:08,305 --> 01:36:11,141
and we would have no knowledge
of the Force.

1284
01:36:11,225 --> 01:36:13,143
They continually speak to us,

1285
01:36:13,227 --> 01:36:16,188
telling us the will of the Force.

1286
01:36:16,438 --> 01:36:18,399
When you learn to quiet your mind,

1287
01:36:18,482 --> 01:36:20,192
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1288
01:36:20,859 --> 01:36:22,194
I don't understand.

1289
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:25,864
With time and training, Ani, you will.
You will.

1290
01:36:29,868 --> 01:36:34,206
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to
continue to serve and protect you.

1291
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:35,916
I welcome your help.

1292
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:40,045
Senator Palpatine fears that the
Federation means to destroy me.

1293
01:36:40,129 --> 01:36:42,756
I assure you I will not allow
that to happen.

1294
01:36:43,048 --> 01:36:45,926
Wesa goin' ho-o-o-me!

1295
01:36:46,009 --> 01:36:47,886
ANAKIN: Come on, R2.

1296
01:36:57,855 --> 01:37:00,232
DARTH SIDIOUS:
<i>Is the planet secure?</i>

1297
01:37:00,649 --> 01:37:04,361
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1298
01:37:04,445 --> 01:37:07,781
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1299
01:37:07,865 --> 01:37:14,121
<i>Good. I will see to it that
in the senate things stay as they are.</i>

1300
01:37:14,204 --> 01:37:17,750
<i>I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.</i>

1301
01:37:17,833 --> 01:37:19,543
Yes, my lord.

1302
01:37:19,626 --> 01:37:21,587
A Sith here?

1303
01:37:27,134 --> 01:37:29,386
PILOT: Those are
the forward stabilisers.

1304
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:32,139
And those two control the pitch?

1305
01:37:33,682 --> 01:37:35,350
You catch on pretty quick.

1306
01:37:35,684 --> 01:37:37,102
PANAKA: As soon as we land,

1307
01:37:37,186 --> 01:37:40,189
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1308
01:37:40,272 --> 01:37:44,026
I agree. I'm not sure
what you wish to accomplish by this.

1309
01:37:44,276 --> 01:37:47,446
I will take back what's ours.

1310
01:37:47,529 --> 01:37:49,740
PANAKA: There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

1311
01:37:49,823 --> 01:37:51,742
We have no army.

1312
01:37:51,909 --> 01:37:55,245
And I can only protect you.
I can't fight a war for you.

1313
01:37:56,246 --> 01:37:57,331
Jar Jar Binks.

1314
01:37:58,248 --> 01:38:00,501
Mesa, Your Highness?

1315
01:38:00,793 --> 01:38:04,254
Yes. I need your help.

1316
01:38:08,926 --> 01:38:11,053
I have one battleship on my scope.

1317
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:13,138
OBI-WAN: It's a droid control ship.

1318
01:38:13,305 --> 01:38:15,557
PANAKA: They've probably spotted us.

1319
01:38:15,641 --> 01:38:17,184
We haven't much time.

1320
01:38:28,987 --> 01:38:31,824
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1321
01:38:31,907 --> 01:38:32,950
Good.

1322
01:38:33,033 --> 01:38:35,702
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1323
01:38:35,786 --> 01:38:37,204
The Gungans will not be easily swayed.

1324
01:38:39,414 --> 01:38:42,292
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1325
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:46,755
I'm sorry for my behaviour, Master.

1326
01:38:46,839 --> 01:38:50,384
It's not my place
to disagree with you about the boy.

1327
01:38:52,553 --> 01:38:55,597
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1328
01:38:56,932 --> 01:38:59,226
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

1329
01:39:00,269 --> 01:39:03,355
And you're a much wiser man than I am.

1330
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:06,775
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1331
01:39:13,115 --> 01:39:14,741

Desa nobody dare.

1333
01:39:22,332 --> 01:39:24,459
The Gungan city is deserted.

1334
01:39:24,793 --> 01:39:27,379
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1335
01:39:27,462 --> 01:39:30,340
Do you think they have been
taken to the camps?

1336
01:39:30,424 --> 01:39:33,051
More likely they were wiped out.

1337
01:39:33,135 --> 01:39:36,138
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?

1338
01:39:36,305 --> 01:39:39,516
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1339
01:39:39,850 --> 01:39:43,186
Mesa show you. Come on.
Mesa show you!

We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1350
01:40:41,578 --> 01:40:43,497

Whosa dis?

1352
01:40:48,335 --> 01:40:51,088
- I am Queen Amidala.
- Huh?

1353
01:40:52,047 --> 01:40:53,757
This is my decoy,

1354
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:57,344
my protection, my loyal bodyguard.

1355
01:40:57,844 --> 01:41:01,765
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1356
01:41:02,349 --> 01:41:04,434
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honour,

1357
01:41:04,559 --> 01:41:07,229
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1358

Ah...

01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,564
The Trade Federation

1360
01:41:09,648 --> 01:41:12,150
has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1361
01:41:12,484 --> 01:41:15,487
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1362
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:18,073
I ask you to help us.

1363
01:41:18,156 --> 01:41:20,701
No, I beg you to help us.

1364
01:41:20,993 --> 01:41:23,161
We are your humble servants.

1365

We've sent our patrols.

1374
01:42:15,047 --> 01:42:17,966
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1375

It won't be long, my lord.

<i>This is an unexpected move for her.</i>

1377
01:42:23,597 --> 01:42:25,390
<i>It's too aggressive.</i>

1378
01:42:25,474 --> 01:42:28,018
<i>Lord Maul, be mindful.</i>

1379
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,604
<i>Let them make the first move.</i>

01:42:30,687 --> 01:42:33,273
Yes, my master.

01:42:38,153 --> 01:42:39,863

They're here!

1384
01:42:44,785 --> 01:42:46,119
Good. They made it.

1390
01:43:04,554 --> 01:43:05,972
General?

1391
01:43:08,767 --> 01:43:10,352
QUI-GON: Captain.

1392
01:43:10,435 --> 01:43:13,230
- PANAKA: Your Highness.
- PADMÉ: What is the situation?

1393
01:43:13,313 --> 01:43:14,981
Almost everyone's in camps.

1394
01:43:15,065 --> 01:43:16,733
A few hundred police and guards

1395
01:43:16,817 --> 01:43:18,443
have formed an underground
resistance movement.

1396
01:43:18,527 --> 01:43:21,113
I brought back
as many of the leaders as I could.

1397
01:43:21,446 --> 01:43:25,826
The Federation army's also much larger
than we thought, and much stronger.

1398
01:43:27,327 --> 01:43:30,413
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1399
01:43:30,622 --> 01:43:32,624
The battle is a diversion.

1400
01:43:32,707 --> 01:43:35,585
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1401
01:43:35,961 --> 01:43:37,671
R2.

1402
01:43:38,130 --> 01:43:42,217
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1403
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:43,802
Once we get to the main entrance,

1404
01:43:43,885 --> 01:43:46,930
Captain Panaka will create a diversion.

1405
01:43:47,013 --> 01:43:50,016
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1406
01:43:50,517 --> 01:43:53,895
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1407
01:43:53,979 --> 01:43:55,480
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1408
01:43:55,647 --> 01:43:57,566
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1409
01:43:57,774 --> 01:44:00,318
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1410
01:44:00,402 --> 01:44:02,612
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1411
01:44:03,029 --> 01:44:07,450
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1412
01:44:07,617 --> 01:44:10,829
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1413
01:44:10,912 --> 01:44:14,249
PADMÉ: We have a plan which should
immobilise the droid army.

1414
01:44:14,499 --> 01:44:16,168
We will send what pilots we have

1415
01:44:16,251 --> 01:44:19,421
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1416
01:44:19,629 --> 01:44:22,507
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1417
01:44:22,674 --> 01:44:25,510
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1418
01:44:25,594 --> 01:44:27,512
OBI-WAN: There's an even bigger danger.

1419
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:29,598
If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness,

1420
01:44:29,681 --> 01:44:31,975
he will return with another droid army.

1421
01:44:32,267 --> 01:44:35,520
Well, that is why we must not
fail to get the viceroy.

1422
01:44:35,604 --> 01:44:38,315
Everything depends on it.
